# Project Documentation

This documentation is auto-generated based on the AI rules defined in `AI_RULES.md`. It serves as a central guide for contributors.

## Contents
- Coding Standards (`coding-standards.md`)
- UI/UX Guidelines (`ui-ux.md`)
- Component & Layout Conventions (`components-layout.md`)
- API Guidelines & Docs Structure (`api-guidelines.md`)
- Testing Strategy (`testing.md`)
- AI Assistant Behavior (`ai-behavior.md`)

Each section is derived from the canonical rules. Keep `AI_RULES.md` as the single source of truthâ€”update it first, then regenerate docs if needed.
